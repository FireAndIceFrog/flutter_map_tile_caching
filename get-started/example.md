# Example

This package contains a full example application showcasing most of the features of this package. Simply [clone this project](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter\_map\_tile\_caching.git), open the 'example' directory, and then build for your desired platform using Dart and Flutter:

* Android & Windows users should run 'androidBuilder.bat'
* Android & Linux/MacOS users should run 'androidBuilder.sh' (bash, untested)

... to build the smallest output .apk files possible.\
There is no build automation for iOS devices: users will need to build manually as usual.

{% hint style="danger" %}
By using the example application, you must comply to your tile server's ToS. OpenStreetMap's (the default throughout the application) can be [found here](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles). If you cannot comply to these rules, you should find one that you can comply to and get the appropriate source URL (which can be customised in the application).
{% endhint %}

Feel free to use the example app as a starting point for your application. Many screens should fit into any app - perhaps with some restyling to fit your app.
