## Supporting Me

A donation through my Ko-Fi page would be much appreciated - Ko-fi doesn't take a fee, so all donated money goes to me: <https://ko-fi.com/jaffaketchup>, but if you can't or won't, a star on GitHub and a like on pub.dev would also go a long way!

Every donation/star/like gives me 'mental fuel' to continue my open-source projects and lets me know that I'm doing a good job.

## Credits

The basis of this library was originally coded by [bugDim88](https://github.com/bugDim88), and improved upon by [multiple people](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter_map_tile_caching/graphs/contributors).
